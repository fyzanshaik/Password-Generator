# Password Generator Application

The Password Generator Application allows you to generate secure passwords with customizable options.

## Usage

1. Open the `ex.java` file.

2. Run the `main` method in the `ex` class.

3. You will be prompted to provide the following inputs:
   - **How many characters do you need?**: Enter the desired length for your password.
   - **Would you like only alphabets(A)/symbols(B) or both(C)?**: Choose the type of characters you want in your password.

4. Enter the desired number of characters and the choice for password generation.

5. The application will generate a password based on your inputs and display it.

## Files

- `ex.java`: The main class that runs the password generator application. It takes user inputs and generates passwords using the `passwordGenerator` class.

- `passwordGenerator.java`: The password generator class that contains the logic for generating passwords based on the specified requirements. It uses random number generation and character manipulation to create secure passwords.

## Note

- Uncomment the code inside the `main` method if you want to measure the execution time of the password generation process. It uses the `System.nanoTime()` method to calculate the execution time in nanoseconds.

- Make sure to enter capital letters for the choice input (A, B, or C) to ensure proper execution.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and enhance the application as per your requirements. You can modify the code to add additional features, improve the user interface, or optimize the password generation logic.
